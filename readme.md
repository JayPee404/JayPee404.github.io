Welcome to my first actual project. 
This will comprise of a very simple HTML-based recipe website featuring some of my favourite and simplest recipes in order to practice and consolidate my HTML skills. It will feature easy-to-follow recipes accompanied by pictures (if I can find any).
Enjoy, and feel free to give me any feedback if you notice anything out of place.
