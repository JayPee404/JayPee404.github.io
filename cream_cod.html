        <p><em>Ingredients</em></p>
        <ul>
            <li>One or two pieces of frozen salted cod, normally found in Portuguese grocers;</li>
            <li>1KG Frying Potatoes (Any high starch potato will do), cut into small-medium cubes;</li>
            <li>500ml milk;</li>
            <li>250ml water used to boil cod;</li>
            <li>3 tbsp flour;</li>
            <li>1-2 onions;</li>
            <li>3-6 garlic cloves, to taste;</li>
            <li>50g butter;</li>
            <li>Nutmeg to taste;</li>
            <li>Salt to taste.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><em>Steps</em></p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large pot, cover cod with water and bring to a boil. Remove from heat and leave to cool;</li>
            <li>Break cod down, removing any bones and skin. Cod should tear very easily into chunks. Preserve 250ml of the water;</li>
            <li>In an appropriate pot, bring oil to temperature and begin to fry your potatoes in batches. Drain them in a bowl with paper towel to remove excess oil;</li>
            <li>While your potatoes fry, in a large pot, brown onions in olive oil over low heat. Add garlic once browning starts;</li>
            <li>Add butter and, once everything is nice and brown (onion and garlic should be very fragrant at this point), add half of your cod and stir-fry, carefully not to break down the chunks too much;</li>
            <li>Cover with the flour and nutmeg and add milk to create a sort of bechamel texture in the pan, add the cod water. Reduce.</li>
            <li>Once mixture thickens, lower the heat and add the remainder of the cod, stirring occasionally. Add potatoes as they finish frying (don't forget to drain the excess oil!);</li>
            <li>Once everything is in the pot you should have what looks like a thick, creamy potato and cod stew;</li>
            <li>Move contents into an oven-appropriate dish, add cream and stir loosely into mixture;</li>
            <li>Bake for 20-30 minutes until the top begins to char. Once cooked, allow it to rest for a few minutes to let everything set;</li>
            <li>Bon appetit!</li>
        </ol>
